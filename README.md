# Prototypes & Exploratory Projects
This repository serves as a collection of small-scale, educational projects and code snippets developed during my learning journey in Python programming, machine learning, deep learning, and data science.

These projects are not production-ready but are valuable for showcasing concepts, practice workflows, and experimentation with various tools and models.
